    <h1>My Love, Karuna Reddy ❤️</h1>

    <p>Thank you for coming into my life.</p>

    <p>
        From the moment you walked into my life, everything quietly changed.
        The world feels warmer, days feel lighter, and even silence feels beautiful—
        because somewhere in it, I feel you.
        You didn’t just become a part of my life; you became the reason my heart
        smiles without any reason at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love the way you exist so naturally in my thoughts.
        In the middle of a busy day, your smile appears like a gentle miracle.
        At night, when the world slows down, it’s your voice my heart listens for.
        Loving you doesn’t feel like an effort—it feels like coming home.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are my comfort when I’m tired, my strength when I’m weak,
        and my happiness when I don’t even know I need it.
        With you, love feels safe… deep… and endlessly beautiful.
        Every heartbeat of mine seems to whisper your name,
        as if my heart has chosen you forever.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t promise a perfect life, but I promise a sincere love.
        I promise to hold your hand through storms and sunshine,
        to listen, to understand, and to love you more with every passing day.
        If love had a face, it would look like you.
        If forever had a meaning, it would be us.
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter where life takes us, remember this—
        there is a heart that beats only for you,
        a soul that feels complete because of you,
        and a love that grows stronger every time I think of you.
    </p>

    <div class="signature">
        Always yours,<br>
        With all my heart,<br>
